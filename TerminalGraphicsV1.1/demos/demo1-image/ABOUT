This is a reiteration of the demo3 from the TerminalGraphicsV1 folder

In this iteration:
I put the terminal grphics class into a header file for readability and code hygene
I put the image encoding into a .txt file in the project folder and read it instead of keeping the encoding in a matrix at compile time.
This also reduces clutter and generally makes the method much more elgant.

Overall this iteration is a significant improvement and I shall be using this going forward.
This also opens the possibility to compression for the encoding with algorithms such as RLE (run length encoding).
This also opens the possibility to video - when I was storing an array - the amount of code for a video would be absurd and quite frankly - stupid.
Now with the file reading i can store the encoding ofr the video out of the code and also compress it whic hsaves space and many headaches!

Now on the users end, they need to format the directories to acess the files but is not too difficult so I will continue to use this solution.
