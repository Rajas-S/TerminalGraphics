place an image file where your python script is and run this code -
run the function encodeImage with the arguments of:
(string imageName, int tilesetSize).

the output will be a .txt file called output.txt that will contain the encoding for the image 
that can be read by a c++ program as seen in TerminalGraphicsV1_1/demos/demo1_image.cpp
